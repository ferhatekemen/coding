  <p id="tribute-info">Here's a time line of Fresco's life:</p>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1916</strong> - Born in Manhattan, New York</li>
      <li><strong>1930</strong> - He left home at the age of 14, hitchhiking and "jumping" trains as one of the so-called "Wild Boys of the Road".</li>
      <li><strong>Late 1930s</strong> - worked at Douglas Aircraft Company in California. He presented designs including a flying wing and a disk-shaped aircraft. Some of his designs were considered impractical at the time and Fresco's design ideas were not
        adopted.
      </li>
      <li><strong>1942</strong> - was drafted into the United States Army. He was assigned technical design duties for the United States Army Air Forces at Wright Field design laboratories in Dayton, Ohio.
        <li><strong>1948</strong> - along with his associates Harry Giaretto and Eli Catran conceived, designed and engineered a project house called the Trend Home. </li>

        <li><strong>Late 1940s</strong> - created and was director of Scientific Research Laboratories in Los Angeles. During this period, Fresco struggled to get his research funded and faced setbacks and financial difficulties.</li>
        <li><strong>1955</strong> - moved to Miami, Florida. He opened a business as a psychological consultant, but had no formal schooling in the subject. Receiving a "barrage of criticism" from the American Psychological Association Fresco stopped that
          business. In a newspaper article from that time period Fresco claimed to have a degree from Sierra University, Los Angeles, California, which is unverified.</li>
        <li><strong>1961</strong> - with Pietro Belluschi and C. Frederick Wise, Fresco collaborated on a project known as the Sandwich House.Consisting of mostly prefabricated components, partitions, and aluminum, the project sold houses for $2,950, or $7,500
          with foundation and all internal installations.</li>
        <li><strong>1969</strong> - Looking Forward was published. Author Ken Keyes Jr., and Jacque Fresco coauthored the book. Looking Forward is a speculative look at the future. The authors picture an ideal 'cybernetic society in which want has been banished
          and work and personal possessions no longer exist; individual gratification is the total concern'.</li>
        <li><strong>1990s</strong> - Fresco, with Meadows, supported the project in the 1990s through freelance inventing, industrial engineering, conventional architectural modeling, and invention consultations.</li>
        <li><strong>2002</strong> - published his main work The Best That Money Can't Buy
        </li>
        <li><strong>2006</strong> - William Gazecki directed the semi-biographical film about Fresco, Future by Design.
          <li><strong>2008</strong> - Peter Joseph featured Fresco in the film Zeitgeist Addendum where his ideas of the future were given as possible alternatives. Peter Joseph, founder of the Zeitgeist Movement began advocating Fresco's approach.</li>
          <li><strong>2010</strong> - traveled with Meadows, worldwide to promote interest in the Venus Project.</li>
          <li><strong>2011</strong> - On January 15, Zeitgeist: Moving Forward was released in theaters, featuring Fresco.</li>
          <li><strong>2012</strong> - Roxanne Meadows released a film, Paradise or Oblivion, summarizing the goals and proposals of the Venus Project. In June 2012, Maja Borg screened her film, Future My Love, at the Edinburgh International Film Festival
            featuring the work of Fresco and Roxanne Meadows.</li>
          <li><strong>2017</strong> - dies at the age of 101.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>"Fresco's future may, of course, seem outmoded and his writings have been subject to critique for their fascistic undertones of order and similitude, but his contributions are etched in the popular psyche and his eco-friendly concepts continue to
      influence our present generation of progressive architects, city planners and designers."
